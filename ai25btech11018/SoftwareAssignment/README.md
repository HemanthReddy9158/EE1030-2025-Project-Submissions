This project implements image compression using the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The goal is to demonstrate the principles of data reduction by reconstructing an image using only the most information-dense components.

The implementation follows a Hybrid Python + C architecture: the computationally intensive matrix operations are handled by C code, while Python manages data handling, visualization, and plotting.
